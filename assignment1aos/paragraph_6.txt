Advantages:-The most obvious advantage of this technique is that a user-level threads package can be implemented on an Operating System that does not support threads.User-level threads does not require modification to operating systems.Simple Representation: Each thread is represented simply by a PC, registers, stack and a small control block, all stored in the user process address space.Simple Management:  This simply means that creating a thread, switching between threads and synchronization between threads can all be done without intervention of the kernel.Fast and Efficient:  Thread switching is not much more expensive than a procedure call.
