advantages:-Because kernel has full knowledge of all threads, Scheduler may decide to give more time to a process having large number of threads than process having small number of threads.Kernel-level threads are especially good for applications that frequently block.diadvantages:-The kernel-level threads are slow and inefficient. For instance, threads operations are hundreds of times slower than that of user-level threads.Since kernel must manage and schedule threads as well as processes. It require a full thread control block (TCB) for each thread to maintain information about threads. As a result there is significant overhead and increased in kernel complexity.
