

1: Open the "aos.ipynb" file in the Jupyter Notebook compiler and execute the code step by step. Use the "file.txt" as the input text file. Upon successful execution, a folder named "individual text files" will be generated, containing the split individual text files.

2: Utilize the code to process the "individual text files" folder, extracting word frequencies for each individual text file and returning them as a dictionary.

3: Execute the third code script using the compiler. This code utilizes the previously generated files to calculate the word frequency of the input text file ("file.txt"). The results are then presented in the Aggregated Word Counts.

- The input text file remains "file.txt."
- The final report, including code screenshots and output, is stored in "finalreport.pdf."
- The word frequency of "file.txt," obtained from the "aos.ipynb" output, is compared with the results from the "count word frequency" tool, demonstrating accurate results. Thus, confirming the successful execution of the distributed word count application.
