main difference is Users implement the user-level threads. On the other hand, the OS implements kernel-level threads.
User-level threads may be created and handled much faster. In contrast, kernel-level threads take longer to create and maintain.The entire process is halted if a single user-level thread carries out a blocking operation. On the other hand, if a kernel thread carries out a blocking operation, another thread may continue to run.The user-level thread library includes the source code for thread creation, data transfer, thread destruction, message passing, and thread scheduling. On the other hand, the application code on kernel-level threads does not include thread management code. It is simply an API to the kernel mode.User-level threads do not invoke system calls for scheduling. On the other hand, system calls are used to generate and manage threads at the kernel level.The user-level thread is also referred to as the many-to-one mapping thread, as the OS assigns each thread in a multithreaded process to an execution context.
